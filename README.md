# Upload Instructions

1. /index.js hosts all the JavaScript code for this project. As we have already set up most of it, you should just be able to copy the `io.on('connection', (socket) => { ... });` block into Sentinel.

2. /views/index.html hosts all the HTML for this project. Don't worry about picking out changes; you can just replace the existing index.html with this one.

3. /sims holds all the simulations. You can copy this directory into your desired location as-is.

4. https://voss-test.herokuapp.com hosts a functioning version of this program, and is what I will be using at the academic showcase. You can reference it if you have any questions about routes/query params not obvious from the structure in index.js
